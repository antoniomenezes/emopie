San Miniato did not answer the remark, for he distrusted her and fancied she might have a retort ready.|11|12|[1]|['disgust']|1
San Miniato was surprised, and not altogether agreeably, by her extreme clearness of perception when they actually arrived at the main discussion.|0|4|[5]|['surprise']|1
San Miniato would soon take up his own life of amusement by day and night, in his own fashion, and Beatrice on her side would form her own friendships and her own ties as best pleased her, subject only to occasional interference from the Count, when he chanced to be in a jealous humour, or when it happened that Beatrice was growing intimate with some lady who had once known him too well.|41|42|[3]|['joy']|1
Sara gave a start of joy; her whole look changed.|0|2|[3]|['joy']|1
Sara's green-gray eyes fixed themselves on her with the quiet, clear look Miss Minchin particularly disliked.|17|20|[0, 1]|['anger', 'disgust']|2
Sarasate is like a brilliant meteor streaming across their narrow bit of the heaven of music; they stare, gape, and think it is an unnatural phenomenon--a 'virtuosity' in the way of meteors, which they are afraid to accept lest it set them on fire.|48|49|[2]|['fear']|1
Save him, Giovanni,--he looks so miserable, cried Corona, with ready sympathy.|14|16|[4]|['sadness']|1

Secondly, San Miniato would be with Ruggiero in the flames, and throughout all eternity Ruggiero would have the undying satisfaction of having brought him there without any one's help.|22|26|[3]|['joy']|1
See how pale and angry he looks.|5|6|[0, 1]|['anger', 'disgust']|2
See that you do her bidding faithfully, as being near the blessed end, and fearful of losing even one moment in the attainment of what you seek.''  |27|28|[2, 3]|['fear', 'joy']|2
She began to talk eagerly.|0|1|[3, 5]|['joy', 'surprise']|2
She came running forward, and threw her arms round the elder woman and kissed her; it was almost the greeting of a daughter to a mother.|0|1|[3, 5]|['joy', 'surprise']|2

She complimented me much upon my French - should never have known me to be English - had known my uncle, Sir John, in Germany - recognised in me, as a family trait, some of his GRAND AIR and studious courtesy - asked me to call.'|0|1|[3, 5]|['joy', 'surprise']|2
She could say to herself: You are free to love him; then love and be satisfied.|6|7|[3]|['joy']|1
She discovered how certain sweet looks of hers could draw me to her side, a willing and devoted slave; she measured my weakness with her own power; she knew--what did she not know?|10|11|[0, 2, 4]|['anger', 'fear', 'sadness']|3
She does not know what a coward I am, you see, and I hope she will never find out, for nothing was ever said to me that gave me half so much pleasure as to be called brave by her, the dear child; and if she never finds out she may say it again, some day.|14|15|[1, 2, 3]|['disgust', 'fear', 'joy']|3
She does not like me; though perhaps it is my fault, because I do not like her.|10|11|[4]|['sadness']|1
She ended, with a strange burst of passion.|0|1|[3]|['joy']|1
She felt better after having her glass; her thoughts were no longer on the river lying at the end of Wellington Street, but on the passengers in the Strand, the swaggering mummers, male and female; the men with lordly airs and billycock hats; the women with yellow hair and unholy looks upon their faces.|0|1|[3]|['joy']|1
She felt the truth of his unspoken argument--of all that his tone implied.|13|14|[0]|['anger']|1
She found beautiful new flowers growing in her room, whimsical little gifts tucked under pillows, and once, as they sat together in the evening, they heard the scratch of a heavy paw on the door, and when Sara went to find out what it was, there stood a great dog--a splendid Russian boarhound--with a grand silver and gold collar bearing an inscription.|0|1|[3]|['joy']|1
She gave a little cry as she saw Madame de Châteauvieux enter.|6|7|[4]|['sadness']|1
She had flung away the hateful hand which held her, and, with a cry, instinct with the sharp and terrible despair of youth, she had thrown herself at the feet of her lover.|27|28|[0, 1, 2, 4]|['anger', 'disgust', 'fear', 'sadness']|4

She had tried to make herself look tidy and thought she had succeeded, but tidy or untidy, it was all the same, nothing mattered now; she was done for.|30|31|[3, 5]|['joy', 'surprise']|2
She has just finished her housekeeping, she puts down her basket of keys, and with all the beautiful movement of the young mother she takes up the crawling mass of white frock, kisses her son and settles his blue sash.|26|27|[3, 5]|['joy', 'surprise']|2
She heard the wild thin wind screeching across the ocean furrows, breathless in his race with death. |17|18|[1, 2, 4]|['disgust', 'fear', 'sadness']|3
She hesitated long--fully half an hour, the squire thought; but in the end she put out her small hand and laid it in his, and thanked God that a man so generous and true, and whom she so honestly loved, was to be her husband as well as her friend and protector.|43|44|[3]|['joy']|1
She kept a great deal to her own room, but was always engaged in study, and seemed to find peace in that way.|0|1|[3]|['joy']|1
She knew that she was speaking recklessly, without a thought for dignity.|3|4|[1]|['disgust']|1
She laughed again,--a clear, exultant laugh.|0|1|[3, 5]|['joy', 'surprise']|2
She lay as she had lain in one of her terrible dreams--quite still, the slender body covered by a sheet, moulding it with sculptured delight and love.|3|4|[0, 1, 2, 4]|['anger', 'disgust', 'fear', 'sadness']|4
She looked at the packet of letters, kissed the crumpled calico rose, the button she had pulled off his coat in a drunken fit and preserved for love, and she even slipped on her wrist the last few pearls that remained of the chaplet she wore when they played at sweethearts in _The Lovers' Knot_.|52|53|[3, 5]|['joy', 'surprise']|2
She looked very miserable, with her white face and weary eyes.|0|1|[0, 1, 4]|['anger', 'disgust', 'sadness']|3

She loved to hold a secondary position; she placed herself in willing subjection to Joseph--a man of austere and simple life, advanced in years, and weighted with the cares of a family by a previous marriage--who wedded her by AN INFLUENCE WHICH COMPELLED HIM to become her protector in the eyes of the world.|8|9|[3]|['joy']|1
She met with a bad accident, and has not been out hunting lately.|0|1|[1, 2, 4, 5]|['disgust', 'fear', 'sadness', 'surprise']|4

She sat closeted with her all the rest of the afternoon, and it must be admitted that poor Miss Amelia passed through more than one bad quarter of an hour.|19|23|[1, 4]|['disgust', 'sadness']|2
She sat with her eyes downcast, her slim hand dabbling in grass, like a maid waiting for love's summons.|8|9|[3]|['joy']|1
She saw that you were a hard-hearted, worldly woman, and that I was a weak fool, and that we were both of us vulgar and mean enough to grovel on our knees for her money, and behave ill to her because it was taken from her--though she behaved herself like a little princess even when she was a beggar.|15|16|[1]|['disgust']|1

She stood before her, arranging the manacles on her wrists nervously.|10|11|[2]|['fear']|1
She struggled hard against these dark thoughts; but it was no use.|0|1|[0, 2, 4]|['anger', 'fear', 'sadness']|3

She was far from spiritual arrogance; her natural mood was a profound humility; she deemed herself rather below than above the active toilers, whose sweat was sacred; but life had declared that such toil was not for her, and from Stella she derived the support which enabled her to pursue her path in peace--a path not one with Stella's.|58|59|[3]|['joy']|1
She was free, and the man whom she loved with the love of years, with the first love of maidenhood and the confirmed love of maturity, was but a few yards from her--it might be, had even come here on purpose to meet her.|8|9|[3]|['joy']|1
She was here with me yesterday; how beautiful she looked, and how graceful were her laughter and speech, he said, turning suddenly and looking down on the landscape; on the massy trees contrasting with the walls of the town, the spine-like bridge crossing the marshy shore, the sails of the mill turning over the crest of the hill.|9|10|[3]|['joy']|1
She was no longer the girl who questioned her heart as to the significance of the vows required in the marriage service; in looking back upon those struggles she could have wept for pity.|29|30|[4]|['sadness']|1
